##INTRODUCTION

This program provides an example of populating a databse using extracted XML data using Python.

##REQUIREMENTS

Python 3 is required, along with several libraries, all of which comes standard in Continuum's Anaconda Python distrbution (found here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

SQLite is recommended, though not required (found here: http://sqlitebrowser.org/). All the data can be accessed using Python. However, using SQLite Browser may make some manipulations easier.
